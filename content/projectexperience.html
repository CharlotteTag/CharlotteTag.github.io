                    Link-Up is a distributed social networking platform which offers an alternative to the inconvenience of creating endless different social 
                    media accounts. The application acts as a central hub, allowing users to create and interact with content across different websites without 
                    even leaving the Link-Up home page. When a user creates a post, follows another user, leaves a comment, or likes a friend's post, this data 
                    will be shared with users all across Link-Up's connected servers.

                    I worked in a team of five to create this project as a part of my Web Applications and Architecture course, CMPUT 404. Using the Django web 
                    framework, we developed our RESTful API in Python, and designed a sleek, modern user interface. Link-Up was a complex project with many 
                    important API endpoints for communicating with other servers. To ensure the accuracy and efficiency of these endpoints, we used the Django 
                    test client to write a comprehensive test suite. We deployed the website using the Heroku cloud platform, and adopted a PostgreSQL database 
                    to store client data. At the end of the semester, we had the opportunity to present Link-Up and its various features to our instructor and 
                    fellow classmates.

                    Snack N' Track is an Android application that simplifies meal planning. Through this one product, users can browse their recipes, build a 
                    weekly planner, create a shopping list, and track which items are in their pantry. The app's mission is to reduce the amount of time shoppers 
                    spend in the store, and to cut down on food waste in North America.

                    I collaborated with five fellow students to develop this application. This was our final project for CMPUT 301 - Introduction to Software 
                    Engineering, and it was meant to simulate the real design stages of modern day software products. To coordinate our work, we followed the 
                    agile development methodology. This meant engaging in frequent stand-up meetings, regular sprint-planning sessions, and agile testing. Our 
                    stand-up meetings were especially valuable, as they allowed us to quickly gauge everyone's individual progress, and discuss any issues we were 
                    encountering. We built the application itself in Android Studio. We first used models such as UML diagrams to create a preliminary 
                    object-oriented design, then implemented this design in Java. Once our app was complete, we presented a pitch for our product to the course 
                    instructor and the rest of our lab section.
