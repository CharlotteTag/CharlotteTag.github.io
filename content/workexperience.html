                    Geering Up is an outreach organization run coordinated through the Faculty of Applied Science at the University of British Columbia. 
                    They run programs all across the province with the aim of engaging youth in STEM. My first involvement with Geering Up was in highschool 
                    when I volunteered at their South Surrey summer camps. I fell in love with their mission and programming, so once I began my 
                    post-secondary education, I applied to become an instructor. Working at Geering up allowed me to develop strong leadership skills. 
                    Specifically, I learned that a good leader needs to be organized, empathetic, and adaptable.
