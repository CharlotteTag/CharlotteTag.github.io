                <p class="paragraph-text indent">
                    Geering Up is an outreach organization run coordinated through the Faculty of Applied Science at the University of British Columbia. 
                    They run programs all across the province with the aim of engaging youth in STEM. My first involvement with Geering Up was in highschool 
                    when I volunteered at their South Surrey summer camps. I fell in love with their mission and programming, so once I began my 
                    post-secondary education, I applied to become an instructor. While my official role throughout my time at Geering Up was Outreach 
                    Facilitor (later Senior Outreach Facilitor), I worked in three distinct positions, all of which I have detailed below.

                <p class="paragraph-text indent">
                    The first instructor position I held at Geering Up was Online Clubs Instructor. While in this role, I taught a weekly coding camp over Zoom 
                    to children aged 10-12. The program lasted six weeks, and we remained with the same group each session. This role was very flexible, as I 
                    was able to learn the curriculum at my own pace throughout the week. The projects we taught were written in Scratch, a highly visual 
                    block-coding language intended to help youth learn to code. Running the online clubs was a great way to prepare myself for my full-time 
                    position in the Summer. I not only learned how to be a fun and patient instructor, but I also gained valuable experience managing a large group 
                    virtually. Keeping kids engaged over Zoom is not always an easy task, but taking advantage of features such as polls or reactions helped
                    me identify attendees who needed extra help and ensure the children were enjoying the activities.

                <h2 class="paragraph-title2 squish">Online Camps Instructor</h2>
                <h3 class="paragraph-title3">June-September 2021</h3>
                <p class="paragraph-text indent">
                    Online Camps Instructor was my first full-time role. Each week for the entire Summer, I would run two camps per day over Zoom with a
                    co-instructor. These camps were two hours long each, and featured a new group every week. The remainder of our workday would be spent preparing 
                    for the next day's activities and completing administrative work. While Geering Up as a whole ran many programs for several different age groups, 
                    I was mainly responsible for teaching the high school coding camps. These were more similar to a course than a camp, and were meant for youth aged 
                    12-17. The four programs I taught were Python Level 1, Python Level 2, JavaScript Level 1, and JavaScript Level 2. The level one courses were 
                    designed for complete beginners, and covered everything from creating variables to building classes in their respective languages. The level two 
                    camps picked up where the previous camps left off, and taught the students more advanced topics such as cryptography and designing graphics. Each camp 
                    featured several smaller coding problems we would assign to the campers based on what we had learned that day, as well as a large final project
                    we would complete together on the last day of camp.

                <p class="paragraph-text indent">
                    Leading these virtual coding camps improved my programming abilities and pushed me to become a self-sufficient learner. Before the Summer began,
                    I was proficient in Python, but had never used JavaScript. During training however, I found out that I would be running a JavaScript Level 1 camp in my first
                    week of camps! This left me just under a week to become proficient in the language. My goal was to learn enough JavaScript to not only be able to confidently run the 
                    activities, but to also be comfortable answering any questions the students had. I wanted to be both an organized instructor and a helpful resource to those 
                    considering a future in Computer Science. Thus, I had to buckle down and teach myself the fundamentals of the language very quickly. In the end, I learned 
                    all the material for both JavaScript Levels 1 and 2, while also familiarizing myself with some concepts not covered in our camps. While the JavaScript knowledge
                    I gained was valuable, the most beneficial skill I acquired from this experience was how to teach myself a coding language. This ability has allowed me to 
                    confidently start new projects, knowing I can learn the necessary tools along the way.

                <p class="paragraph-text indent">
                    I worked as an in-person instructor at Geering Up's South Surrey location for two summers. In this role, I worked with youth aged 6-12, and led a variety of
                    different programs with themes such as coding, game design, and engineering. In South Surrey, we would run 5-6 camps per week, with two instructors per group.
                    The group sizes varied from 12-20 campers, and also included 1-3 high school volunteers who would help us prepare materials and watch over the children.
                    I led plenty of activities across these two summers, and taught a variety of lessons to go along with them. Some of the most fun and memorable projects included:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="paragraph-text">Designing Minecraft mobs using 3D modelling software,</li>
                    <li class="paragraph-text">Training a machine-learning program to sort recycling,</li>
                    <li class="paragraph-text">Creating bottle rockets,</li>
                    <li class="paragraph-text">Copper electroplating nails with pennies, and</li>
                    <li class="paragraph-text">Building earthquake-resistant towers out of craft materials.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="paragraph-text indent">
                    Taking on this in-person position meant accepting much more responsibility. As instructors, we were in charge of both keeping the campers entertained and 
                    also keeping them safe. To accomplish this, I learned to stay organized and communicate effectively with my team. Every day before camp, we would
                    ensure all preparation was complete and any potentially hazardous materials that we needed, such as hot glue guns, hot plates, or scissors (for the younger
                    groups) were supervised. During the day, we would do head counts before heading inside or outside, check lunches to ensure every child had enough to eat and 
                    nothing with nuts, and carry our first aid kit constantly. We also always communicated to our SAs where our group would be and when, and ensured that 
                    two staff members were supervising the campers at all times. These practices were effective at making our programs run smoothly, and preventing any serious
                    incidents.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph-text indent">
                    A new skill I developed while working at these camps was conflict resolution. Almost every week, there would be at least one dispute among campers, and often
                    multiple issues would arise in a day. One of my main goals as an instructor was to ensure every child had the best experience possible, but when two have a 
                    disagreement, this isn't always an easy task. Thus, I learned to apply my problem-solving skills and come up with creative solutions that appeased both sides.
                    For example, many of our activities were group projects, where only one camper would get to keep the end result. Often, this would lead to conflict since 
                    everyone would want to take it home. In response to these disputes, my co-instructors and I would help the group to compromise. If the campers truly could not
                    decide who would take home the project, I would offer to keep their project at camp, and use it as an example for future groups. That way they got to feel 
                    proud of their work, knowing that it would be shown off to other kids in their place. Another vital part of conflict resolution I learned is taking the 
                    time to empathize with each party's perspective. It was much easier to understand the problem once I grasped how each child was feeling, and it helped me to 
                    develop a solution that would truly address everyone's concerns. While some of the situations I faced may have been specific to camps, conflict resolution is 
                    a leadership skill I feel confident applying in my future career. My experience at Geering Up taught me how to harness both creativity and empathy when issues arise, 
                    and these will remain valuable regardless of the setting.
