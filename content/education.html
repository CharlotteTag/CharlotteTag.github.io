                <h3 class="paragraph-title3">September 2020-June 2024</h3>
                <p class="paragraph-text indent">
                    I studied at the University of Alberta in order to obtain my Bachelor of Science with Specialization
                    in Computing Science and a Minor in Business. By specializing in computing science, I gained a comprehensive understanding of the 
                    fundamentals of computing, including algorithm design, computer architecture, cryptography, and the structure of the web. I also developed 
                    practical skills to assist me in starting my career as a software engineer, such as proficiency in a wide assortment of programming 
                    languages, experience collaborating under the agile methodology, and the ability to thoughtfully test my code. Meanwhile, my minor in 
                    business granted me insight as to how organizations operate, familiarized me with complex financial mechanisms, and broadened my critical 
                    thinking skills. This paired nicely with my major by offering me more general knowledge that will remain applicable regardless of how my 
                    career progresses.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph-text indent"> 
                    Completing this degree is my proudest accomplishment. I entered the specialization in computing science program with a passion for coding 
                    but minimal technical knowledge, and through dedication to my studies, I was able to achieve a 3.9 GPA in my final year, and an overall GPA of 
                    3.6.

                    Below, you will find an outline of the most valueable courses I completed at the University of Alberta.

                <h2 class="paragraph-title2">CMPUT 291 - Introduction to File and Database Management</h2>
                <p class="paragraph-text indent">
                    In CMPUT 291, I had the opportunity to learn about how computers organize and retrieve large amounts of data.
                    The lecture material covered all the basics of data storage, from memory hardware to the structure of Relational and NoSQL databases.
                    The class included a mix of individual and collaborative assignments. Through these assignments, I learned how to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="paragraph-text">Model conceptual schemas using ER diagrams,</li>
                    <li class="paragraph-text">Build relational databases,</li>
                    <li class="paragraph-text">Write SQL queries,</li>
                    <li class="paragraph-text">Evaluate different indexing methods, and</li>
                    <li class="paragraph-text">Create and query MongoDB databases.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="paragraph-text">
                    All programming I did for this class was written in Python, using the SQLite3 and PyMongo libraries.
                </p>
                <h2 class="paragraph-title2">CMPUT 301 - Introduction to Software Engineering</h2>
                <p class="paragraph-text indent">
                    CMPUT 301 taught me the fundamentals of software engineering. The lectures examined various topics in software development,
                    such as design patterns, UML diagrams, and the basics of object-oriented design, but the most valuable part of the class was the
                    semester-long group project. The project was a simulation of how a real software engineering firm would create an application for 
                    a new client. Our group learned to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="paragraph-text">Form user stories from the client's requirements,</li>
                    <li class="paragraph-text">Build an object-oriented design based off these user stories,</li>
                    <li class="paragraph-text">Implement this design in Java,</li>
                    <li class="paragraph-text">Create a clean, user-friendly UI,</li>
                    <li class="paragraph-text">Write unit tests to thoroughly test our codebase, and</li>
                    <li class="paragraph-text">Follow agile software development practices.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="paragraph-text">
                    I've included a more detailed description of this project on my <a class="paragraph-link" href="/content/projectexperience.html">Project Experience</a> page.
                </p>
                <h2 class="paragraph-title2">CMPUT 304 - Algorithms II</h2>
                <p class="paragraph-text indent">
                    CMPUT 304 was a theory-based class which took a more in-depth look at algorithm design. The lectures covered various topics, including
                    NP-completeness, asymptotic runtime proofs, linear programming, and approximation algorithms. This course was invaluable to my degree,
                    not only because many of the algorithms we covered reappeared in my other courses, but also because it taught me to strive for more 
                    efficient solutions to my future projects and assignments.
                </p>
                <h2 class="paragraph-title2">CMPUT 379 - Operating System Concepts</h2>
                <p class="paragraph-text indent">In CMPUT 379, I learned about the complexities of operating systems. The lecture material included process and thread 
                    basics, inter-process communication facilities, and memory management. The coursework consisted of individual coding assignments
                    which covered:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="paragraph-text">Using threads to create a server with multiple clients,</li>
                    <li class="paragraph-text">Sending packets to and from a server using sockets, and</li>
                    <li class="paragraph-text">Solving the dining philosophers problem with semaphores.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="paragraph-text">
                    I wrote all of these assignments in C.
                </p>
                <h2 class="paragraph-title2">CMPUT 404 - Web Applications and Architecture</h2>
                <p class="paragraph-text indent">
                    CMPUT 404 was the most valuable course I took throughout my entire degree. Through the lectures, I learned about the fundamental workings
                    of the web, including the HTTP essentials, different authentication methods, RESTful APIs, and AJAX. The labs granted me hands-on experience with:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="paragraph-text">Using Django and Flask to create web applications,</li>
                    <li class="paragraph-text">Editing HTML files,</li>
