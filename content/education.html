                <h4>September 2020-June 2024</h4>
                <p class="indent">
                    I studied at the University of Alberta in order to obtain my Bachelor of Science with Specialization
                    in Computing Science and a Minor in Business. By specializing in computing science, I gained a comprehensive understanding of the 
                    fundamentals of computing, including algorithm design, computer architecture, cryptography, and the structure of the web. I also developed 
                    practical skills to assist me in starting my career as a software engineer, such as proficiency in a wide assortment of programming 
                    languages, experience collaborating under the agile methodology, and the ability to thoughtfully test my code. Meanwhile, my minor in 
                    business granted me insight as to how organizations operate, familiarized me with complex financial mechanisms, and broadened my critical 
                    thinking skills. This paired nicely with my major by offering me more general knowledge that will remain applicable regardless of how my 
                    career progresses.
                </p>
                <p class="indent"> 
                    Completing this degree is my proudest accomplishment. I entered the specialization in computing science program with a passion for coding 
                    but minimal technical knowledge, and through dedication to my studies, I was able to achieve a 3.9 GPA in my final year, and an overall GPA of 
                    3.6.
