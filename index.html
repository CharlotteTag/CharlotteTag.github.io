                    Welcome to my website! My name is Charlotte Kalutycz and I am a recent graduate of the Department of Computing Science at the University of Alberta.
                    I first began coding when I was 15 years old, and I've been in love with programming ever since. I have a passion for developing creative solutions
                    to unique problems, and a broad toolkit of technical knowledge to help me along the way. In my spare time, I love playing D&D, checking out the latest
                    Pok√©mon games, and baking banana bread.
                    <br>
                    I am currently seeking the opportunity to contribute to an innovative company in the software industry. I am able to offer both strong technical skills,
                    as well as a passion for creative problem-solving. I am proficient in languages such as
                    <ul>
                        <li>Python,</li>
                        <li>Java,</li>
                        <li>C/C++,</li>
                        <li>HTML/CSS, and</li>
                        <li>Javascript.</li>
                    </ul>
                    I am confident working alone, but also have extensive practice working collaboratively, in both large teams of 15+, and more small-scale groups of 6 or less
                    developers. To learn more about the specifics of my education, project experience, and
                    work experience, please visit the corresponding pages via the menus located at the top and bottom of this page.

                <h2>About This Website</h2>
                <p>
                    I built this website from the ground up by applying the web development knowledge I gained throughout the course of my degree.
                    All of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript within this project was written by me. I deployed my site
                    using GitHub Pages, so that lovely readers like you can access it. You can check out my GitHub repo <a href="https://github.com/CharlotteTag/CharlotteTag.github.io">here</a>. 
                    Please take advantage of the navigation menus located in the header and
                    footer of this page to traverse the site and read more detailed descriptions of my education and experience. Thank you for visiting!
