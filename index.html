                    Welcome to my website! My name is Charlotte Kalutycz and I am a recent graduate of the Department of Computing Science at the University of Alberta.
                    I'm a bilingual (English/French) Canadian citizen originally from Surrey, BC and currently located in Edmonton, AB.
                    I first began coding when I was 15 years old, and I've been in love with programming ever since. I have a passion for developing creative solutions
                    to unique problems, and a broad toolkit of technical knowledge to help me along the way. I'm proficient in:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Python,</li>
                    <li>Java,</li>
                    <li>C/C++,</li>
                    <li>Javascript,</li>
                    <li>HTML/CSS,</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    and I'm eager to learn more languages as my career progresses. My ultimate goal is to contribute to a software company which truly improves the lives
                    of its users. There are countless applications that have helped me progress through my education, work experience, and personal life, and I hope to
                    one day design software which can likewise help others succeed.
